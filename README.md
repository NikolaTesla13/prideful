## How to run

Build the project using `cargo`. Right now you must manually **copy** the `flags.json`
file to your `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory. The path should be `~/.config/prideful/flags.json`.

```git clone https://github.com/angelofallars/prideful```

```cd prideful```

```cargo install --path .```

```cp -r ./config ~/.config/prideful```
