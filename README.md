## Config

The config file is located in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/prideful/prideful.yml`, usually `~/.config/prideful/prideful.yml`.
Flags are defined using YAML syntax, which means that adding new flags should be very easy.

Example snippets from the default config:
```yaml
  # Left is the color code in hexadecimal notation, right is the height of the stripe.
  classic:
    - [ "#E50000", 2 ]
    - [ "#FF8D00", 2 ]
    - [ "#FFEE00", 2 ]
    - [ "#028121", 2 ]
    - [ "#004CFF", 2 ]
    - [ "#770088", 2 ]

  bi:
    - [ "#D60270", 4 ]
    - [ "#9B4F96", 3 ]
    - [ "#0038A8", 4 ]

  trans:
    - [ "#5BCFFB", 2 ]
    - [ "#F5ABB9", 2 ]
    - [ "#FFFFFF", 2 ]
    - [ "#F5ABB9", 2 ]
    - [ "#5BCFFB", 2 ]
```
